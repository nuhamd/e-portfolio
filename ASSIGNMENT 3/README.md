#ASSIGNMENT 3

## Summary

From this assignment, I had to create an e-portfolio through GitHub as the medium.

In this e-portfolio, I introduced myself, a brief of my academic journey and what I have gained throughout the whole of it. I also had to learn on how to use and
navigate GitHub, to enhance the whole process of finishing this portfolio.

## Reflections 

Creating an e-portfolio in GitHub has enhance my knowledge and technical skills in the navigation of the platform. It also offered a deep understanding of how to 
effectively showcase my work, assignments, projects and myself as a computing student, in a more professional and accessible manner. I get to have a hands-on practice
on navigating Github, which is a crucial aspect in my future endeavors later on in the field. This was definitely an important learning curve for me as it emphasized the
skills of good documentation, presentation and organization in digital world.
