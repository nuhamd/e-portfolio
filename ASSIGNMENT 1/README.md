#ASSIGNMENT 1

## Summary

From this assignment, I had to create a report regarding on performance analysis using the tool Google Lighthouse matrix.

I had to choose a main website concept, and in regards to this assignment, I had chosen Tourism websites to evaluate upon. I chose this concept mainly because it was
one of my mainly used websites, and it would be beneficial for me to compare the myriads of tourism websites on the Internet. During the whole evaluation using the 
Google Lighthouse Matrix, I could understand better on the topic and the importance of creating an overall great website, as a web developer.

## Reflections 

This was a new experience and valuable knowledge for me as I have never had a chance to navigate through this tool and to check the matrices. Throughout creating this report,
I also understand clearly on ways to evaluate websites, and how each website is carefully curated by developers with the customer needs in mind.
I would love to have more report-type assignments as it could better my ways of understanding the topic, as well as making my articulation of words clearer to conduct
certain evaluation/reports.
