#ASSIGNMENT 2

## Summary

From this assignment, I had to create a personal website using the knowledge I have learned in Web Programming class, HTML and CSS combined.

Before the creation of my personal website, I had to choose several web provider, several aesthetic concepts to match my persona and several considerations regarding
the placement of the sections, colors and more. During the website creation, I had encounter considerable amount of problems in my codes of HTML and CSS. But all in all,
I could finish my very own first personal website within the given period of time, and most importantly, being hugely proud of it.

## Reflections 

For this exact assignment, I had the chance to apply some if not all, classes, lectures and study resources in creating this website. I now understand better in HTML and CSS
languages, how it works on the website, and how to carefully choose the right codes to match with the ideas and creativity one had in mind in web development.
It was not an easy task to do, and as a beginner myself, I could not help but to think what a huge achievement one might have, after successfully creating and
developing a website. This has urged me to do well and better in my journey of becoming a web developer in the future.
